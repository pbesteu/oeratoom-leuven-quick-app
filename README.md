# Local Cultural Heritage Quick App

The Local Cultural Heritage Quick App promotes cultural heritage collections in small and medium cities through open data and crowdsourcing. 

> It's free, open-source, and collaborative 

Any city can implement its own application in a few hours. They only need one or more experts to feed the first version of the database.   
Currently, we have the following proofs of concept:

- [Leuven (Belgium)](https://espinr.github.io/local-cultural-heritage/be/leuven) 
- [Eckernf√∂rde (Germany)](https://espinr.github.io/local-cultural-heritage/de/eckernforde)
